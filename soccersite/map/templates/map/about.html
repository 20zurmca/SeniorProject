    <p class="info">
      Soccer Hotspots is a data visualization project intended
      to locate high schools of Division-One collegiate soccer
      players who have a proven record of success. Literature from authors
      such as <a href = "https://marksbookreviews.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/the-talent-code-by-daniel-coyle/" target = "_blank">
      Daniel Coyle </a> suggests that talent isn't born, rather developed. In the football world, for example,
      Super Bowl MVP quarterbacks Nick Foles and Drew Brees both hail from Westlake High School in Austin,
      Texas, an acclaimed football powerhouse. This project applies similar logic to soccer.

    <p class="info">
      Using roster data from 34 academically-oriented colleges and universities
      across 11 Division-One conferences starting from 2006, we compiled a web application
      that allows Lafayette College's Men's Soccer recruiters to strategically locate the
      players they need. By filtering players based on their league, college, position, number of years
      they were a starter (playing at least 50% of season games), and number of
      years they received an all-conference award, recruiters have great
      versatility in finding talent. We hope our software
      will help streamline the recruiting process for future seasons and
      supplement current practices.
